1) Z algorithm (string prefix thing on geeksforgeeks, UCF 2018 online)
2) Node Splitting Dijkstras (Wipeout from UCF online 2017)
3) Longest Increasing Subsequence (with binary search, SPOJ)
4) Longest Common Subsequence Speedup? (SPOJ)
5) Convex Hull! (SI 2018 Contest 5, fence one)

7) Floyd warshalls (kattis problem from last year in spencers lecture...)
8) Fix seg tree... (add lazy value and segment addition, haybales from SI practice 2018 (might be a USACO problem))
